## 🎨 UI/UX MONETIZATION BEST PRACTICES

- After 5 likes used (daily limit)
- When clicking "See Who Liked You"
- After viewing 10 profiles
- When trying advanced filters
- After first match (momentum!)

### 2. Value Messaging
**Don't say:** "Subscribe to Premium"
**Do say:** "Find your match 10x faster with Premium"

**Don't say:** "Buy coins"
**Do say:** "Boost your profile, get more matches"

### 3. Social Proof
- "Join 1,000+ Premium members"
- "Premium users get 5x more matches"
- "Most popular plan" badge

### 4. Urgency & Scarcity
- "50% off - First month only"
- "Limited time: Bonus 200 coins"
- "Flash sale: 24 hours only"

### 5. Free Trial Psychology
- "Try Premium FREE for 7 days"
- "Cancel anytime, no commitment"
- Email reminder day 5: "2 days left in trial"

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Paywall too early (let users experience value first)
2. Remove core features from free tier
3. Make pricing confusing (keep it simple)
4. Ignore free users (they're your growth engine)
5. Price too low (hard to raise later)
6. Launch without A/B testing
7. Forget to celebrate upgrades (confetti animation!)

### ✅ DO:
1. Let users browse freely, paywall actions
2. Show value before asking for money
3. Offer limited-time discounts
4. Personalize offers based on behavior
5. Make premium features visible (but locked)
6. Celebrate milestones with coin rewards
7. Test different price points

---

## 💰 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY TACTICS

### 1. Anchoring
Show Premium ($19.99) first, makes Plus ($9.99) seem reasonable

### 2. Decoy Effect
Make Basic look less attractive to push users to Plus:
- Basic: $4.99 (meh features)
- Plus: $9.99 (best value! ⭐)
- Premium: $19.99 (overkill for most)

### 3. Loss Aversion
"Don't miss out on your match! Upgrade to see who liked you"

### 4. Scarcity
"Limited offer: 50% off Premium - 12 hours left"

### 5. Social Proof
"Sarah upgraded to Plus and found her match in 3 days!"

---

## 🎯 GROWTH HACKS FOR REVENUE

### 1. Win-Back Campaigns
**Email churned subscribers:**
- "We miss you! 50% off to come back"
- "New features you haven't seen"
- "Your matches are waiting"

### 2. Milestone Upsells
**When user gets first match:**
- "Congrats! Upgrade to see who else likes you"
- "Get 3x more matches with Premium"

### 3. FOMO Triggers
**When someone views your profile:**
- "Someone just viewed you! Upgrade to see who"
- Push notification → App open → Paywall

### 4. Bundle Deals
- "Valentine's Day Special: Premium + 1000 coins = $24.99 (save $15)"
- "Summer Love Bundle: 3 months Plus = $24.99"

### 5. Gifting
**Let users gift Premium to matches:**
- "Send 1 month Premium to your match"
- Price: $14.99 (higher than subscription price)
- Creates obligation/reciprocity
